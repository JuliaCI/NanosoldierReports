There are four tests for arrowhead matrices, a random matrix test and three
tests from the arrowhead paper [1] (see README for details)
   1st test - Random SymArrow matrix
   2nd test - Example 1, p. 15 from [1]
   3rd test - Example 2, p. 16 from [1]
   4th test - Example 3, p. 17 from [1]

There are four tests for DPR1 matrices, a random matrix test and three
tests from the DPR1 paper [2] (see README for details)
   1st test - Random SymDPR1 matrix
   2nd test - Example 1, p. 9 from [2]
   3rd test - Example 2, p. 10 from [2]
   4th test - Example 3, p. 11 from [2], see also Ming Gu's paper

There is one test for SVD of HalfArrow matrices
   HalfArrow with entries varying in magnitude

We test tridiagonal divide and conquer on the Wlikinson's matrix W21

There are three tests for roots of polynomials
   Example 1 from [3] - the Wilkinson's polynomial p18
   Example 2 from [3]
   Example 3 from [3] - the Chebyshev polynomial T[374]
