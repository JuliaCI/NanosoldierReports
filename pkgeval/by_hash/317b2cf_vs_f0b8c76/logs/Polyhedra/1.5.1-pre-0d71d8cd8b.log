┌ Warning: Cannot detect exact linearity as no solver was provided and the polyhedron is not affine.
│ As fallback, we will only detect halfspaces from opposite hyperplanes but that may not detect all halfspaces.
│ Set a solver if you believe that the polyhedron may have more linearity.
│ To provide a solver to a polyhedron, first select a solver from https://www.juliaopt.org/JuMP.jl/stable/installation/#Getting-Solvers-1.
│ If you choose for instance `GLPK`, do `using GLPK; solver = GLPK.Optimizer`.
│ Then provide the solver to the library. For instance, with the default library, do `lib = DefaultLibrary{Float64}(solver)`
│ or if you use an external library, say `QHull`, do `lib = QHull.Library(solver)`.
│ Then when you create the polyhedron, say from a representation `rep`, do `polyhedron(rep, lib)`.
