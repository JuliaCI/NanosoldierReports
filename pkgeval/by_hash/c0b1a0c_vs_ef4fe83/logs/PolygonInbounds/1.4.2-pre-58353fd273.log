        INPOLY2 provides fast point-in-polygon queries for ob-
 
        jects in R^2. Like INPOLYGON, it detects points inside

        and on the boundary of polygonal geometries.

        INPOLY2 supports multiply-connected geometries, consi-

        sting of arbitrarily nested sets of outer + inner bou-

        ndaries.

INPOLY2 implements a "pre-sorted" variant of the cros-

sing-number test - returning queries in approximately 

O((N+M)*LOG(N)) time for configurations consisting of 

N test points and M edges. This is often considerably 

faster than conventional approaches that typically re-

quire O(N*M) operations.
