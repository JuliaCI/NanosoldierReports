1000 interpolations of 6 dimensions with 15 cut points per dimension:
  Rectangle required 0.003310849535000001 +/- 0.0036389288471073856 sec
  Simplex   required 0.002238942470000001 +/- 0.025892702055001125 sec
How large is the simplex grid speed up over the multilinear grid?
  limiting to 2 dimensions and therefore 316 points per dim:
    mean speed: 0.0011995277666666665, std dev: 7.517697691160383e-5
  limiting to 3 dimensions and therefore 46 points per dim:
