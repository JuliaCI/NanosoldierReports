1000 interpolations of 6 dimensions with 15 cut points per dimension:
  Rectangle required 0.0024110830690000002 +/- 0.002490386272109435 sec
  Simplex   required 0.0012981143109999991 +/- 0.0077771710782163165 sec
How large is the simplex grid speed up over the multilinear grid?
  limiting to 2 dimensions and therefore 316 points per dim:
    mean speed: 0.0009640646000000001, std dev: 0.0002592935304056669
  limiting to 3 dimensions and therefore 46 points per dim:
