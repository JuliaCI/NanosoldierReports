1000 interpolations of 6 dimensions with 15 cut points per dimension:
  Rectangle required 0.0033473123479999993 +/- 0.0033759969187306844 sec
  Simplex   required 0.0018189998220000004 +/- 0.009462162694035872 sec
How large is the simplex grid speed up over the multilinear grid?
  limiting to 2 dimensions and therefore 316 points per dim:
