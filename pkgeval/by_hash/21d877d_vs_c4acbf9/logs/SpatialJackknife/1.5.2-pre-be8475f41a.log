┌ Warning: Package SpatialJackknife does not have NearestNeighbors in its dependencies:
│ - If you have SpatialJackknife checked out for development and have
│   added NearestNeighbors as a dependency but haven't updated your primary
│   environment's manifest file, try `Pkg.resolve()`.
│ - Otherwise you may need to report an issue with SpatialJackknife
└ Loading NearestNeighbors into SpatialJackknife from project dependency, future warnings for SpatialJackknife are suppressed.
