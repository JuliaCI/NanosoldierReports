No quick solution. Using integer programming.
Welcome to the CBC MILP Solver 
Version: 2.10.3 
Build Date: Oct  7 2019 

command line - Cbc_C_Interface -solve -quit (default strategy 1)
Continuous objective value is 0 - 0.00 seconds
Cgl0004I processed model has 72 rows, 72 columns (72 integer (72 of which binary)) and 432 elements
Cbc0012I Integer solution of 0 found by DiveCoefficient after 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.01 seconds)
Cbc0001I Search completed - best objective 0, took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.01 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 0 to 0
Probing was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
Gomory was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
Knapsack was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
Clique was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
MixedIntegerRounding2 was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
FlowCover was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
TwoMirCuts was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
ZeroHalf was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)

Result - Optimal solution found

Objective value:                0.00000000
Enumerated nodes:               0
Total iterations:               0
Time (CPU seconds):             0.01
Time (Wallclock seconds):       0.01

Total time (CPU seconds):       0.01   (Wallclock seconds):       0.01
