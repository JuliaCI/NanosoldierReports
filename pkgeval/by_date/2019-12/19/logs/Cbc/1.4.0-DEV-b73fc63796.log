Welcome to the CBC MILP Solver 
Version: 2.10.3 
Build Date: Oct  7 2019 

command line - Cbc_C_Interface -logLevel 1 -solve -quit (default strategy 1)
Continuous objective value is -16.5 - 0.00 seconds
Cgl0004I processed model has 1 rows, 5 columns (5 integer (5 of which binary)) and 5 elements
Cbc0012I Integer solution of -16 found by DiveCoefficient after 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0001I Search completed - best objective -16, took 1 iterations and 0 nodes (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 4 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -16.5 to -16
Probing was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
Gomory was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
Knapsack was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
Clique was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
