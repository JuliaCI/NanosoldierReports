┌ Warning: Package RobotDescriptions does not have RigidBodyDynamics in its dependencies:
│ - If you have RobotDescriptions checked out for development and have
│   added RigidBodyDynamics as a dependency but haven't updated your primary
│   environment's manifest file, try `Pkg.resolve()`.
│ - Otherwise you may need to report an issue with RobotDescriptions
└ Loading RigidBodyDynamics into RobotDescriptions from project dependency, future warnings for RobotDescriptions are suppressed.
