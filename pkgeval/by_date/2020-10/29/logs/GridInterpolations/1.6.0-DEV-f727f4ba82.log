1000 interpolations of 6 dimensions with 15 cut points per dimension:
  Rectangle required 0.00327394606 +/- 0.0031365336180149196 sec
  Simplex   required 0.0017087797600000025 +/- 0.01014779189052294 sec
How large is the simplex grid speed up over the multilinear grid?
  limiting to 2 dimensions and therefore 316 points per dim:
    mean speed: 0.0011347037666666663, std dev: 0.00011273494105559815
  limiting to 3 dimensions and therefore 46 points per dim:
