1000 interpolations of 6 dimensions with 15 cut points per dimension:
  Rectangle required 0.002477519378999998 +/- 0.002627992105263758 sec
  Simplex   required 0.0013920625019999998 +/- 0.009890369535436302 sec
How large is the simplex grid speed up over the multilinear grid?
  limiting to 2 dimensions and therefore 316 points per dim:
