1000 interpolations of 6 dimensions with 15 cut points per dimension:
  Rectangle required 0.0032846602909999984 +/- 0.0034669369230374164 sec
  Simplex   required 0.0018905350929999997 +/- 0.011753995619576787 sec
How large is the simplex grid speed up over the multilinear grid?
  limiting to 2 dimensions and therefore 316 points per dim:
