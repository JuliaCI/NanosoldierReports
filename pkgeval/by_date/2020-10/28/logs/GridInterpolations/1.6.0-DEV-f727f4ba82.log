1000 interpolations of 6 dimensions with 15 cut points per dimension:
  Rectangle required 0.0029734529000000035 +/- 0.0033760325478228064 sec
  Simplex   required 0.0018427560380000008 +/- 0.01038896784792131 sec
How large is the simplex grid speed up over the multilinear grid?
  limiting to 2 dimensions and therefore 316 points per dim:
    mean speed: 0.0008698218, std dev: 0.00013776321077939595
  limiting to 3 dimensions and therefore 46 points per dim:
