A 3 meters long pole is traveling quickly toward a barn that is shorter than its length.
Measured in the inertial system of the pole with l=length of pole and c=1,
at time t:
Base of pole: x´ = 0,	t´ = t
Tip of pole: x´ = 1.3333333333333333 l,	t´ = t + (-0.6666666666666666) l
Time at the tip is earlier than at the base, hence when the tip touches the barn wall the base has had time to enter.
The pole is rotated about the time axis of the barn. When one object is rotated relative to another their projections become dwarfed, like when drawing a line at right angle from the minute pointer of a clock to its hour pointer, the projection becomes progressively smaller until it disappears at ninety degrees which in this analogy is light speed. Photons can therefore be complete universes that are rotated at right angles with respect to this universe.
