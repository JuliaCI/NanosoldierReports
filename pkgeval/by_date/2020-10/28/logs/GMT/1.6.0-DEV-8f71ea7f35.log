You don't seem to have GMT installed and I don't install it automatically,
so you will have to do it yourself.

┌ Warning: Assignment to `GG` in soft scope is ambiguous because a global variable by the same name exists: `GG` will be treated as a new local. Disambiguate by using `local GG` to suppress this warning or `global GG` to assign to the existing global variable.
