┌ Warning: Package AssociativeArrays does not have Transducers in its dependencies:
│ - If you have AssociativeArrays checked out for development and have
│   added Transducers as a dependency but haven't updated your primary
│   environment's manifest file, try `Pkg.resolve()`.
│ - Otherwise you may need to report an issue with AssociativeArrays
└ Loading Transducers into AssociativeArrays from project dependency, future warnings for AssociativeArrays are suppressed.
┌ Warning: **Quick upgrade guide**: `f::Transducer |> g::Transducer` is deprecated.
│ Instead of
│ 
│     collect(Filter(f) |> Map(g), xs)
│     foldl(+, Filter(f) |> Map(g), xs)
│ 
│ it's now recommended to use `|>` with input collection
│ 
│     xs |> Filter(f) |> Map(g) |> collect
│     foldl(+, xs |> Filter(f) |> Map(g))
│ 
│ If there is no input collection; e.g.,
│ 
│     foldl(right, GroupBy(key, Filter(f) |> Map(g), push!!), xs)
│ 
│ use `opcompose` instead:
