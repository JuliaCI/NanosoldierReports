┌ Warning: Package FlightMechanics does not have Dierckx in its dependencies:
│ - If you have FlightMechanics checked out for development and have
│   added Dierckx as a dependency but haven't updated your primary
│   environment's manifest file, try `Pkg.resolve()`.
│ - Otherwise you may need to report an issue with FlightMechanics
└ Loading Dierckx into FlightMechanics from project dependency, future warnings for FlightMechanics are suppressed.
