Integrating 1/sqrt(-19.6 sin(x)) from -pi to 0 and comparing the result to the analytical solution of ellipk(1/2)/sqrt(2.45) The integrand has singularities at x = -pi and x=0, so for some of these functions the integration domain has to be itself approximated.
Running: adaptive_simpsons_rule on [-pi+1e-8, -1e-8]. Only a rough approximation can be realistically achieved with this function, due to the singularities.
