┌ Warning: Package Zomato does not have HTTP in its dependencies:
│ - If you have Zomato checked out for development and have
│   added HTTP as a dependency but haven't updated your primary
│   environment's manifest file, try `Pkg.resolve()`.
│ - Otherwise you may need to report an issue with Zomato
└ Loading HTTP into Zomato from project dependency, future warnings for Zomato are suppressed.
WARNING: Compat.Test is deprecated, use Test instead.
