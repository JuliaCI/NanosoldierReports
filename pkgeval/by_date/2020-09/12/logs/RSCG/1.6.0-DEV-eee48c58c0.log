┌ Warning: Package RSCG does not have LinearMaps in its dependencies:
│ - If you have RSCG checked out for development and have
│   added LinearMaps as a dependency but haven't updated your primary
│   environment's manifest file, try `Pkg.resolve()`.
│ - Otherwise you may need to report an issue with RSCG
└ Loading LinearMaps into RSCG from project dependency, future warnings for RSCG are suppressed.
